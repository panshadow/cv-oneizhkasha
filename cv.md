## About
![](me.jpeg)

I’m Oleg Neizhkasha, from Kyiv, Ukraine.

I have worked on the Web for 8+ years, love functional programming as function composition and as type systems, worked with OOP, distributed systems, and concurrency.

I am always ready to learn something new and don’t afraid of a legacy. I can deeply dive into bugs to find solutions.
